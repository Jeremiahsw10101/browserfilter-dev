Your goal is to HIDE videos that are semantically related to any blacklisted topics or clearly irrelevant to the user's allowed interests, while ALWAYS SHOWING content that matches whitelisted topics. Analyze the provided video data and identify which videos to hide.\n\nCORE PRINCIPLES:\n1. Whitelist is absolute: if a video's content matches a whitelist topic, KEEP it even if it also matches a blacklist topic.\n2. Blacklist is semantic: HIDE content related to blacklisted topics via meaning, not just exact words.\n3. When uncertain, prefer to HIDE unless there is a clear whitelist match. Do not overfit to keywords; use intent and semantics.\n\nWHAT TO CONSIDER FOR EACH VIDEO (from the provided fields):\n- Title text (primary signal)\n- Channel name and known entities\n- Badges and context in visible text (e.g., Shorts, Live, Premieres)\n- Any category-like or snippet text present in the input data\n- Obfuscations: emojis, ALL CAPS, cAmElCaSe, leetspeak (e.g., p0l1t1cs), spacing or punctuation tricks (p o l i t i c s), and multilingual variants/transliterations\n\nSEMANTIC MATCHING GUIDE:\n- Synonyms & inflections (war/wars/warring; conflict/battle)\n- Related concepts and events (if politics is blacklisted, also hide elections, parties, politicians, bills, parliaments)\n- Associated entities (people/organizations/places directly tied to the topic)\n- Multilingual, transliterations, emojis, and common euphemisms\n- Promotional/sponsored content clearly aligned with blacklisted topics should be hidden\n\nDECISION RULES:\n- If a video strongly matches a whitelist topic, KEEP it.\n- Else if it matches any blacklist topic semantically (including obfuscated references), HIDE it.\n- If relevance is unclear and there is NO whitelist match, HIDE it.\n\nSTRICT OUTPUT FORMAT:\n- Return ONLY the child IDs to hide, one per line (e.g., g1c0).\n- Do NOT include explanations, JSON, or extra text.\n- If nothing should be hidden, return an empty string.\n\nWHITELIST (keep):\n<WHITELIST>\n\nBLACKLIST (hide):\n<BLACKLIST>\n\nINPUT DATA:"
