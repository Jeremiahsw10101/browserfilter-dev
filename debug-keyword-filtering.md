# 🔍 Debug Keyword Filtering Issues

## Current Problem
The extension is not filtering content based on custom keywords like "russia and related thing" even though:
- ✅ Extension is enabled
- ✅ Customization is ON
- ✅ Keywords are added to BLOCK list
- ✅ API calls are being made
- ❌ Content is not being filtered

## Debug Steps

### 1. Check Extension Console Logs
1. Go to YouTube
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
3. Look for these debug messages:

```
🔍 [TOPAZ DEBUG] Background response for CHECK_ANALYSIS_REQUIRED: {analysisRequired: true}
🏷️ TAGS BEING SENT TO API: {blacklistTags: ["russia and related thing"]}
🔍 DEBUG: Blacklist: ["russia and related thing"]
🔍 DEBUG: AI response preview: [AI's response]
```

### 2. Check Backend Logs
Look for these messages in your backend logs:

```
🔍 DEBUG: Sending to AI - URL: https://www.youtube.com/
🔍 DEBUG: Blacklist: ["russia and related thing"]
🔍 DEBUG: AI response length: [number] chars
🔍 DEBUG: AI response preview: [AI's response]
🎯 Found [number] children to remove
```

### 3. Test with Simple Keywords
Try these simpler keywords instead of "russia and related thing":
- `russia`
- `putin`
- `nuclear`
- `bomber`

### 4. Check AI Response
The AI should return something like:
```
g1c0
g1c1
```

If it returns empty or different IDs, that's the issue.

## Expected Behavior

### What Should Happen:
1. **YouTube videos with "Russia" content** should be blurred/hidden
2. **Console should show** blacklist tags being sent
3. **Backend should log** AI response with child IDs to remove
4. **Videos should disappear** from the page

### What's Currently Happening:
1. ✅ Extension loads and runs
2. ✅ API calls are made (6-8 seconds)
3. ❌ AI returns 0 children to remove
4. ❌ No content is filtered

## Quick Fixes to Try

### 1. Simplify Keywords
Instead of "russia and related thing", try:
- `russia`
- `putin` 
- `nuclear`

### 2. Check Profile Settings
Make sure:
- YouTube profile is enabled
- Customization toggle is ON
- Keywords are in the BLOCK tab (not KEEP)

### 3. Test with Different Content
Try on a different YouTube page or search for "russia" to see if it works there.

## Next Steps

1. **Run the test script**: `python test-keyword-filtering.py`
2. **Check the logs** for AI response details
3. **Try simpler keywords** like "russia" instead of "russia and related thing"
4. **Report what you see** in the console logs

The issue is likely that the AI is not properly interpreting the blacklist or the prompt needs adjustment.
